## Introduction

The Traffic Lights project is aimed at simulating a basic traffic lights system. It provides a visual representation of traffic lights controlling the flow of vehicles at an intersection.

The project utilizes Python to create the simulation and provides a user-friendly interface for controlling the traffic lights.

## Installation

To install and run the Traffic Lights simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

To run the Traffic Lights simulation, execute the following command:

Once the simulation is running, you can interact with the traffic lights system using the provided controls. Use the interface to adjust the timing of the lights or simulate the flow of vehicles.

## Features

The Traffic Lights simulation offers the following features:

- Visual representation of a traffic lights system at an intersection.
- Control panel to adjust the timing of the lights.
- Simulation of vehicle flow and corresponding light changes.
- Real-time display of the current state of the traffic lights.
